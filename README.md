I'm a Data Analytics Graduate, My skills as a Data Scientist are based on a solid mathematical foundation. I
started with a computer science bachelor&#39;s degree from Guru Nanak Dev
University. After that, I just completed postgraduate degree in data science and
cloud computing. This broad and in-depth education is a big component of my
expertise as data scientist. My personality, I believe, has also played a
significant part in my capacity to flourish in this field. I am a very analytical,
data-driven, and calculated person. I like to look at the statistics before making
decisions in my personal life as well. I enjoy analysing outcomes.
