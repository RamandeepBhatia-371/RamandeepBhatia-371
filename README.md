# Hello, folks! This is Raman. <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">


- I'm a recent Data Analytics Graduate, my skills as a Data Scientist are based on a solid mathematical foundation. Mathematics was my major in high school then I
started with a computer science bachelor's degree from Guru Nanak Dev
University.I just completed postgraduate degree in data science and
cloud computing. This broad and in-depth education is a big component of my
expertise as data scientist. My personality, I believe, has also played a
significant part in my capacity to flourish in this field. I am a very analytical,
data-driven, and calculated person. I like to look at the statistics before making
decisions in my personal life as well. I enjoy analysing outcomes.
