# Hello, folks! This is Raman. <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">


- I have spent the past 5+ years doing number crunching and database management/ Data Analysis in previous jobs and academics. I am keen to continue developing my career in the field of Data Science. I have always been a numbers person, with exceptional mathematics and computer skills. I have extensive experience in a number of Data Management systems and programming languages, Operations Research and software, including Excel, MySQL, SPSS, Python, R Language, SQL Server and Oracle DBMS. Statistical significance, A/B testing, and data-driven decision making is the rhythm of the drumbeat I march to. I'm Post Grad in Data Science, my skills are based on a solid mathematical foundation. Mathematics was my major in high school then I started with a computer science bachelor‚Äôs degree from Guru Nanak Dev University. After that, I just completed my postgraduate degree in data science and cloud computing. I enjoy analyzing outcomes.
