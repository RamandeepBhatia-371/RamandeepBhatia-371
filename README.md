#I'm a Data Analytics Graduate, My skills as a Data Scientist are based on a solid mathematical foundation.I
# started with a computer science bachelor&#39;s degree from Guru Nanak Dev
# University. After that, I just completed postgraduate degree in data science and
# cloud computing. This broad and in-depth education is a big component of my
# expertise as data scientist. My personality, I believe, has also played a
# significant part in my capacity to flourish in this field. I am a very analytical,
# data-driven, and calculated person. I like to look at the statistics before making
# decisions in my personal life as well. I enjoy analysing outcomes.
